> ok for the game i want everyone to be able to make seven characters, 3 characters slots for all, in the beginning. everyone must purchase the 4 slots, in game, individually, the first 
purchasable slot should be $5 , then increase by $5  , so $35 for all 4 at first or slot4 $5 slot5 $10 slot6 $15 and the final slot is $20. my account is trubone and i want him to have all
 seven characters to level 300 as soon as i create them, level 300 should be max and should have all things that come with it, do not allocate the accumalted stat points, give all 
neccessary level up achievemrnts or what not... first make the game producion ready but the story mode should be "coming soon" i have my own story i want to put in for it. and i need time 
to type it up and have it perfect before i incorporate it, but as of now, make the game production ready level 300 is max level, only i have max level {account trubone}.
